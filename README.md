# TwoPence

TwoPence believes Financial Freedom is attained by paying off debts, then accumulating assets.

TwoPence generates savings by adding 10% to every dollar you spend. These savings are automatically withdrawn from your account and sent as additional payments to a your debt. Once debt-free, your savings are routed to investments!

A lifetime of saving discipline is reduced to a one-step decision!
