# TwoPence

TwoPence believes Financial Freedom is attained by consistently putting aside meaningful savings, first paying off debts and then accumulating assets.

TwoPence generates savings by adding an extra 10% to every dollar you spend. These savings are automatically withdrawn from your account and sent as additional payments to your student loan. Once debt-free, your savings are routed to a personalized investment portfolio!

TwoPence outsources a lifetime of saving discipline!
